# Hypervolume Indicator Visualization

## Overview
This project includes a Python script designed to visualize the hypervolume indicator in a two-dimensional objective space. The hypervolume indicator is a useful metric in multi-objective optimization, helping to quantify the space covered by a set of points relative to a reference point. The script allows for the calculation of hypervolume increases and visualizes these increases through shaded areas and contour lines in a plot.

## Features
- **Calculate Hypervolume**: Compute the hypervolume covered by a set of points.
- **Visualize Increases**: Display areas where adding a new point exceeds a specified increase in hypervolume.
- **Interactive Contours**: Plot contours to show critical thresholds where the hypervolume increase is significant.

## Prerequisites
Before you can run this script, make sure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.6 or newer
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

You can install the necessary Python packages using pip:
